	"question": "Do you have a low bond rating, or are you concerned that adding additional debt to your balance sheet will raise your cost of capital beyond acceptable limits or negatively impact the availability and cost of your other government borrowing needs?",
	"description": "<p>Buyers in the municipal bond markets determine your cost of capital for a project based on your “bond rating”. Bond rating organizations and independent financial market analysts evaluate your entity’s financial risk profile, in particular the likelihood of investors interested in financing your project receiving a return of and return on their bond investment. A poor bond rating will lower demand for your financing and increase your cost of capital, reflecting the perceived market risk of your ability to repay your debt. If your debt rating is too low, there might not be any market players willing to lend you money. Maintaining your current bond rating may also impact your project financing decision. A primary focus of this question is how the bond ratings agencies will view your issuance of additional debt for your project, i.e., will they lower your bond rating based on your existing debt load, which will increase your cost of capital for this project and all other entity borrowing needs. Your municipal financial adviser will be an important player in analyzing this question and formulating your answer.</p>",
