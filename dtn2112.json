	"description": "<p>Do you have a short fuse for getting this project off the ground and into service? If your project relies on taking advantage of immediate conditions or has a real urgency, you may not have enough time to access private financing as part of your procurement.  Private financing in a public private partnership model can take a significant amount of time to arrange, negotiate, and close.  In such instance, you may wish to issue your own debt as municipal bond underwriting can often have a much shorter time line to financial close.</p>",
