	"question": "Is a referendum or voter approval required before you can issue financing for the project that you expect will not pass? (i.e., Will voters reject this?)",
	"description": "<p>If you must hold a referendum or otherwise obtain voter approval before you can issue financing for your project, you may have a concern that the voters will reject your project financing (even if the project has overall benefit to the community).  In this instance, you may wish to shift the financing burden to the private sector which would not trigger the voter approval requirement.</p>",
